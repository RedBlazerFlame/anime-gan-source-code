# anime-gan-source-code
This is the source code of my grade 9 personal summer project on image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This project was the result of a month of self-studying and implementing.

Credits to [Goodfellow et al. (2014)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2969033.2969125) for developing and popularizing GANs!
